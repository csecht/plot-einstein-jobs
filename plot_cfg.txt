# Do not rename this file or move it from the plot-einstein-jobs folder.

# PURPOSE of this file:
# 1) If the job_log_einstein.phys.uwm.edu.txt file is no longer in its
#    default install location, you can enter its new location here.
# 2) If you want to plot an archived version of the job_log file, then
#    enter that alternate file path here.

# Example path formats (using the default paths) to use in the custom_path line:
# Windows -  \Program Files\BOINC\boinccmd.exe
# Linux - /var/lib/boinc/job_log_einstein.phys.uwm.edu.txt
# Mac - /Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/job_log_einstein.phys.uwm.edu.txt

# Remove the # before custom_path and replace the example with your desired path.

#custom_path your/custom/path/goes/here
